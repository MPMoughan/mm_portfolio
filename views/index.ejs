For me personally, it felt incredibly different from Javascript and it took some time to get used to but, I realized how powerful Rails is as a Framework. This application allows users to store their personal recipe books online, as a result they would have an easier time access all their recipes. Through this app users can search for specific recipes with certain ingredients or ingredients that correlate with specific recipes. I built this app using Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML, and CSS <br/><br/>
